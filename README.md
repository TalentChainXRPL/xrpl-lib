<br/>

 [TalentChain](https://www.talentchain.io) offer opportunities to talented individuals interested in self-monetization by providing access to personal tokens issued on XRP ledger. These personal tokens are available for trading on [TalentChain DEX](https://www.talentchain.io/dex/TALENT), this enable talents to trade services or products they offer in exchange for their own currency (personal token). [TalentChain](https://www.talentchain.io) aims to provide features like vesting, staking, airdrops, minting NFTs and many more, so talents can grow their community.

## TalentChain XRPL API

 TalentChain API uses [xrpl JS/TS npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xrpl) to connect to the XRP ledger via websockets using [mainnet](wss://xrplcluster.com) for interacting with the ledger.

 For receiving information from ledger we utilize [Ripple Data API v2](https://data.ripple.com/v2/).

<br/>

`TalentChain API` ‚Äì TalentChain aims to launch a live instance of this XRPL TS library at this [link](https://api.talentchain.io) public URL in Q3, 2023. More information about rate limiting, etc will be added below this section. 

<br/><br/>

## Upcoming 
We strive to help grow XRPL community and have a keen vision to expand overall web3 usage. We aim to build one-tap solutions for centralized users around the globe to be able to make all sorts of transactions on XRP ledger (the ripple blockchain). 

### TalentChain as FIAT to Crypto Bridge for XRPL

TalentChain is enabling centralized users to be able to trade on XRPL (decentralized space) by acting as a bridge.

Following is a simple diagram explaining how TalentChain bridges FIAT payments to cryptocurrency

![TalentChain bridging fiat to cryptocurrencies on XRPL](./images/talentchain-as-a-bridge.png?raw=true "TalentChain bridging fiat to cryptocurrencies on XRPL")

<p>
  In this diagram, user pays TalentChain from their centralized fiat currency exchange to TalentChain's centralized fiat currency exchange (bank account). After receiving the total amount in fiat for the product/service offered by any seller on TalentChain marketplace, TalentChain transfers the converted amount of cryptocurrency to the seller and that's how TalentChain acts as bridge between centralized and decentralized communities.

TalentChain strives to enable centralized users to interact with the decentralized world seamlessly so that users can exchange their fiat currency for any cryptocurrency on TalentChain, and the converted cryptocurrency will be stored in the user's cryptocurrency wallet operated by TalentChain with user's consent. Users can then use the cryptocurrency to make a purchase from "sellers" on TalentChain marketplace who accept cryptocurrency payments and also invest, trade on TalentChain DEX.
